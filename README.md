# GamingTheNetwork DNA

##What is the project
The current DNA map provides some static info about the coverage with no interactivity

##The solution   

###The Game
The game shows a scenario where two people need to talk over the phone but they are quite far.
To connect them you will have to build a new network by placing radio stations all over the Finland.
When enough radio stations will be placed they will be able to talk.

To place a radio station however you need to answer correctly some questions provided by DNA.
Answering a question you will find out more information about the company and you might win a coupon code.
